# RPG-Game

This project was done, during our third semester of studying at the Witelon State Univeristy of Applied Sciences in Legnica, to pass a course called "Object Oriented Programming"
For us to pass we had to use constructors, encapsulation, interfaces, abstract classes and inheritance.

It is a simple console based game where you choose your character and venture into the dungeon to fight with various monsters in order to get better loot to fight stronger monsters.

## Starting the game
To run the application itself all you have to do is compile the project.
